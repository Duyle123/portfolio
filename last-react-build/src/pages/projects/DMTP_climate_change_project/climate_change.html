			<h1>Topic 1: Food Waste and waste processing in NYC</h1>
			<h2></h2>
			<p>
				According to the USDA (U.S. Department of Agriculture), food waste represents around 30-40% of the
				country's food supply. This creates major problems at landfill sites, where food is converted into
				methane, carbon dioxide, and other greenhouse gasses, which drastically speed up global warming, leading
				to climate change. This problem most influences densely populated areas like New York City, where 4
				million tons of waste is sent to landfills every year, and almost a third of that is food waste.

			<h1>Topic 2: Homelessness and environmental injustice in NYC</h1>
			<h2></h2>
			<p>
				In recent years, homelessness in NYC has risen to the highest level that we've seen since the 1930s
				Great Depression, according to data sources from NYC's Coalition for the Homeless. The lack of
				affordable housing pushes these homeless communities into areas of unsafe, polluted, and toxic
				conditions. In the project, I will take a deeper look into their living conditions, what health risks
				they face from the polluted environment, the cause of their problems, both from an industrial and public
				policy perspective, and the potential solutions.

			<h1>Topic 3: Lack of greenspace in NYC's poor neighborhoods</h1>
			<h2></h2>
			<p>
				New York City is well known for its green spaces, which account for almost 40% of the city, according to
				the Conservancy. However, around these green spaces are occupied by high-income, expensive areas. The
				NYC park system has become the centerpiece of real-estate development, especially in recent years, and
				in order to see a tree for lower-income citizens, you would have to ironically board a train or bus. For
				a city that boasts so much about its green spaces in between all the tiny cramped-up apartment
				buildings, the poorest are the ones who are losing out the most.
