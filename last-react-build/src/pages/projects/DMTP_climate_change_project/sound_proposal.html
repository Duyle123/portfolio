		<h1>Sound Pitch Proposal</h1>

		<h2>Description</h2>

		<!-- ------------------------------Opening---------------------------- -->
		<p>
			One of the most attractive parts about New York City is arguably its park system, which includes some of the
			most renowned parks anywhere in the world - Central Park, Washington Square Park, etc…. However, the big
			park areas in NYC are almost exclusively reserved for high-income residents, while the low-income are the
			ones who are losing out the most due to insufficient green outdoor spaces.
			<br>
			In order to highlight the differences between parks in the city and different neighborhoods, I’m going to be
			making an artistic soundscape that can represent the contrast between all the involved elements. The final
			composition can be perceived as experimental or abstracted, as it will mostly derive from a combination of
			natural sounds (urban and natural environments) and electronic instruments (Computer generated sounds,
			electric organs).

		<h2>Logistics & production details</h2>
		<p>For production, I plan to use very simple tools available to NYU students.</p>

		<h2>Affect and influence</h2>
		<p>
			The composition is meant to impact the audience's hearing sense. It hopes to enhance the audience's learning
			experience while exhibiting the varied environmental sounds and characteristics (the difference between
			contradictory elements in the project and context in which it is played). Since the project surrounds the
			idea of space and the environment, I want the listener to experience that. Firstly through a feeling of the
			natural, of lightness and green which represents the rich, affluent areas of nyc. The soundscape's first
			part will create a very welcoming, elegant feel. Then I would transition to the second part which is
			heavier, tighter, more constrained, which fits more to the image of cramped up apartments in NYC's poor
			neighborhoods where there would be little to no space for experiencing nature.
			<br />
			Through the composition, I hope to make the audience connect more to the ones who are living in New York's
			poorest and richest neighborhoods, and thus further understand the inequality that's happening in the best
			city in the world. I hope that it would incentivize the audience to push for change and actions from our
			leaders and policy makers, to create a living environment that's fair and just, regardless of income or
			race.
