							One of the most attractive parts about New York City is arguably its park system, which includes some of the most renowned
							parks anywhere in the world - Central Park, Washington Square Park, etcâ€¦. However, the big park areas in NYC are almost
							exclusively reserved for high-income residents, while the low-income are the ones who are losing out the most due to
							insufficient green outdoor spaces.
						</p>
						<p>
							In order to highlight the differences between parks in the city and different neighborhoods, I'm making an artistic
							soundscape that can represent the contrast between all the involved elements. The final composition can be perceived as
							experimental or abstracted, as it will mostly derive from a combination of natural sounds (urban and natural environments)
							and electronic instruments (Computer generated sounds, electric organs).
						</p>
						<p>The sound prints I'm looking for includes:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<span class="text_bold">Natural Sounds of Nature</span> - trees, leaves, dirt, walking, jogging - to show the beauty
								and necessity of parks.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="text_bold">Natural Sounds of the City's Streets</span> - cars, metalic noises, train noises, ambience -
								to show the tiring sounds of the city and the people.
							</li>
							<li><span class="text_bold">Instrumental</span> - Upbeat Jazz, Blues, R&B - to capture New York City's senses.</li>
							<li>
								<span class="text_bold">Electronic (Computer Generated) Sounds</span> - to complement the calmness of parks and chaos
								of the city hustle.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>All sounds will either be made by me or non-copyrighted sources.</p>
						<p></p>

						<h4>Affect and influence</h4>
						<p>
							The composition is meant to impact the audience's hearing sense. It hopes to enhance the audience's learning experience
							while exhibiting the varied environmental sounds and characteristics (the difference between contradictory elements in the
							project and context in which it is played). Since the project surrounds the idea of space and the environment, I want the
							listener to experience that. Firstly through a feeling of the natural, of lightness and green which represents the rich,
							affluent areas of NYC. The soundscape's first part will create a very welcoming, elegant feel. Then I would transition to
							the second part which is heavier, tighter, more constrained, which fits more to the image of cramped up apartments in
							NYC's poor neighborhoods where there would be little to no space for experiencing nature.
						</p>
						<p>The particular neighborhoods that I'm visiting are:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<span class="text_bold">The Upper West Side</span>, where there's access to 2 of the biggest parks in NYC - Central
								Park and Riverside Park.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="text_bold">Greenwhich Village</span>, where there's access to piers, Hudson River Park and Washington
								Square Park.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="text_bold">The South Bronx neighborhoods</span>, where there's the beautiful Crotona Park, but also the
								unkempt, under-maintenanced Tremont Park.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="text_bold">The East Flatbush neighborhoods</span>, where lies the tight and often crowded city parks.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							This project is not about amplfying the prejudices against different reighborhoods, rather it's about the things that
							could be done differently or better in order to serve equality among different classes, gender, and race of New Yorkers.
							In order to solve a problem, we need to firstly recognize that there is one, and the visual as well as audio samples being
							represented in this project serves as such.
						</p>
						<p>
							My hope through this composition is to make the audience connect more to the ones who are living in New York's poorest and
							richest neighborhoods, and thus further understand the inequality that's happening in the past few years, in the best city
							in the world. I hope that it would incentivize the audience to push for change and actions from our leaders and policy
							makers, to create a living environment that's fair and just, regardless of income or race.
