			<h2>What</h2></div>
		
		
		<p>
			As part of the overall experience, I'm going to be making a short documentary video. The goal of this documentary is to inform the
			audience about the lack of park space and access in the less affluent neighborhoods in NYC through interviews with people who've been
			affected, and also change makers who are actively fighting for their communities. There will be 2 main elements to focus on in this
			documentary - Sound and Image. Each will be produced independently but still complement each other in the final composition.
		</p>
		<h3>Image</h3>
		<p>
			The visual element of the documentary focuses primarily on showcasing the difference in park accessibility in multiple different
			neighborhoods. There won't be text that says which neighborhoods are the income of the households in the neighborhood. The audience should
			see and realize them themselves. The goal of the visual is not simply to “tell” the viewer that the poor areas are like this but rather to
			inform the viewer of the reality and whether they should do something about it.
		</p>
		<h3>Sound</h3>
		<p>
			The audio component will primarily consist of the interview audio between me and an agent of change. There will also be a mix of
			non-copyrighted background music and sound effects to enhance the viewing experience.
		</p>
		<p>Interview questions details:
		<ol>
			<li>Introduce topic</li>
			<li>Can you talk a little bit about your background and the organization that you're working for?</li>
			<li>What problems are you actively solving?</li>
			<li>How have these problems been addressed in recent years?</li>
			<li>How has your organization worked to solve this problem?</li>
			<li>How would one go about joining your organization or partake in your social activism?</li>
			<li>Do you have anything to say to the New Yorkers who are actively fighting for a climate change solution as a closing statement?</li>
		</ol>
		</p>

		<div class="container"><h2>Why</h2></div>
		<p>
			The documentary serves as an informative, yet creative essay to confront the viewers on the topic of park accessibility in NYC. Thus
			discuss the environmental injustice that we are still fighting against everyday. Many people who live in NYC know about the amount of
			parks and greens that are available, yet are still not aware of the fact that these spaces are unequally distributed. The video hopefully
			can shed some light on this matter, and encourage people to act along with the agents of change.
