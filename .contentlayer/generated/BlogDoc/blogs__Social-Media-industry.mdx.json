Captured from Meta's Official Website.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSnap Inc. is a technology and social media company that operates the popular multimedia messaging and photo app, Snapchat. The company was founded in 2011. Since then, it has grown to become one of the most innovative companies in the industry. In their [10-K](https://investor.snap.com/financials/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=16353304) filings, Snap Inc. identified their mission as: “to contribute to human progress by empowering people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together.” (p. 3) This is most apparent in the way their entire social media platform is created, and the features within it.\r\n\r\n Snapchat, the company's flagship product, allows users to send messages, photos, and videos that disappear after being viewed, creating a unique and ephemeral messaging experience. “To live in the moment” is to take a photo in real time and show the people your current state, and the text messages sent disappear the next time someone opens them, simulating a real conversation even though they are physically far apart. The company also embraced the “fun together” and “express themselves” proposition through a range of filters, lenses, and a map that allow users to show themselves and others in creative ways. In addition to Snapchat, Snap Inc. has also launched several other products and services, including Spectacles, a line of camera-equipped sunglasses, and Bitmoji, a personalized emoji app.\r\n\r\nAccording to their [10-K filing](https://investor.snap.com/financials/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=16353304), Snap Inc. makes 99% of their revenue in the past 3 years (2020-2022) from advertising (p.15). They sell ad placements through 2 main segments: **AR Ads** and **Snap Ads**. AR Ads take advantage of the augmented reality environment. Through the camera, users can try on beauty products from brands, or have the brand ads act as 3d elements, interacting with the world through the camera. On the other hand, the Snap Ads segment focuses on placing ads in between the user active actions. These ads appear when the user is browsing the app in the form of single images or videos, stories, collection tiles, and non-skippable commercials.\r\n\r\nTheir new form of revenue involves selling AR glasses called “Spectacles” that allows users to record videos, see the world with 3d elements integrated into it, and more. The [newest version](https://www.spectacles.com/shop/spectacles-3/) of the glasses cost $380. Further, following the trend of subscription services mentioned in the section above, Snap Inc. offers their Snapchat+ service, where the users can pay only $3.99 a month for exclusive access to new experimental features that haven’t been yet released.\r\n\r\n**Business Fundamentals: **\r\n\r\nSnapchat, as of 2022, brings in over $4.6 billion in revenue. This number was just over $4.1 billion in 2021, meaning there was a 12.2% increase. However, the revenue growth from the year prior (2020-2021) was 104% (from $2.5 billion to $4.1 billion). This sudden decrease in growth indicates a negative trend for the company (decrease from 104% to 12.2%). While growth slowed tremendously, their spending still steadily climbs, thus also increasing their net loss. Snapchat is currently not generating any profit, as their reported loss in 2022 was almost $1.4 billion, doubling their loss from 2021 ($702 million)(p. 79 [10-K](https://investor.snap.com/financials/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=16353304)). This negative financial landscape for Snapchat also stems from the downward demand trend for advertising (mentioned in the Meta section), and the user-privacy crackdown which made it harder for them to target the right consumer (p. 3 [10-K](https://investor.snap.com/financials/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=16353304)). \r\n\r\nIn regards to their demographic, according to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/study/26377/snapchat-statista-dossier/), it was reported that Snapchat is most popular among users from 18-24 (p. 40). Compared to Facebook and Tiktok, Snapchat has more of a presence among younger users. In fact, 21.1% of Snapchat users come from the 13-17 age group. With their new, fun approach to capturing life through the camera lens, it attracts the younger demographic more than its competitors. According to [Social Media Today](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/snapchat-reaches-750-million-monthly-active-users/642977/), as of February 2023, there are 750 million Monthly Active Snapchat users. Compared to its figure from April 2022, this is a 25% increase. This has been an impressive gradual growth in the number of Snapchat users over the years, and the trend doesn’t seem to slow down soon. Yet despite this constant user growth, Snap’s income loss seems to be exponentially higher, and it’s hard to predict how long it will be before Snap Inc. can turn in a positive profit. \r\n\r\n**Recent and Current Initiatives:**\r\n\r\nSnapchat, as mentioned above, in recent years has made tremendous push towards its Augmented Reality (AR) feature. According to [this article](https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/7/23496982/snapchat-ar-lens-purchases-creator-monetization-lensfest) by The Verge, Snap’s goal is to be the center of the AR universe. Rather than trying to create an entirely new virtual reality like the Metaverse, Snap’s goal is to enhance the real world experience, which aligns more with their vision and mission statement. This also prompted the unique AR Ads as the consumer now has the chance to see how the product would actually look like on them without having to physically try them on. Taking this one step further, they also introduced their own AR glasses called “Spectacles.” They’ve also recently introduced “ray tracing,” a popular technical term for realistic 3D light simulations which were only previously possible on heavy-duty computers, to their AR feature ([Social Media Today](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/snapchat-launches-ray-tracing-for-more-realistic-ar-effects/642861/)). Now, users can experience an almost “real-life” product experience through their lenses. \r\n\r\nFollowing the subscription service trend, it was reported that Snapchat launched their own [Snapchat+ subscription plan](https://beebom.com/what-is-snapchat-plus/). With just $3.99 a month, users can now have exclusive access to new, not-yet-released features like custom story expiration, custom notifications sound, badge, border colors, and more. Further, with the loss of access to user data, Snapchat is also turning to the power of Artificial Intelligence to bring in new advertising propositions. The company recently announced that it’s launching [its own chatbot service](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/27/23614959/snapchat-my-ai-chatbot-chatgpt-openai-plus-subscription) named “My AI,” powered by the popular ChatGPT, and this is only available to Snapchat+ subscribers. Thus hope to drive even more revenue towards subscription. It’s quite clear, from what we’re seeing in the two biggest companies, that the trend for the social media industry nowadays is AI integration and creating an attractive subscription model. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. ByteDance’s TikTok\r\n\r\n    **Business and Mission:**\r\n\r\n\r\nTikTok, the social media platform, is a product of TikTok LLC, who is subsequently a subsidiary of China’s tech giant ByteDance. ByteDance also owns and operates many apps in China, one of which is Douyin, who is considered to be the original iteration of TikTok and can only be downloaded in China. For the purpose of this analysis, we’re going to be taking a close look at only TikTok. According to ByteDance’s [website](https://www.bytedance.com/en/), TikTok has only been introduced to the international market in 2017. However, it has quickly risen to be one of the biggest social media platforms in the world. To quote a [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-06-28/how-does-tiktok-make-money-app-relies-on-a-few-main-ingredients) regarding its growth, “There are several ways to measure TikTok’s success: It took just four years to reach 1 billion monthly users; its average user in the US spends more time with the service than with Facebook and Instagram put together.” This kind of growth is incredible to see, and it’s safe to say that TikTok is one of the biggest disruptions we’ve yet seen in the industry. \r\n\r\nThe social media platform made the short-form video content popular around the world. Following its popularity, Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, Reddit, and many other social media platforms also introduced the same feature. The algorithm and the model it pioneered is deeply studied and discussed in [this article by the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/05/business/media/tiktok-algorithm.html). By scrolling through hundreds of short videos over the span of minutes, the feature keeps the users hooked to the screen for a constant period of time. Through tracking user data and interests over the videos, the platform presents the viewer with videos that they know the users like, thus keeping their attention and increasing their watch time by hours on end. \r\n\r\nTikTok’s mission, according to [their website](https://www.tiktok.com/about?lang=en), is: to be “the leading destination for short-form mobile video. Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy.” To achieve this mission, TikTok has employed resources to maintain the app, and to attract more creators to their platforms. By bringing more creators, they bring more diversity and creativity. \r\n\r\nEven though there aren’t specific reports on how TikTok makes money, according to the information gathered from their [TikTok for Business](https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US), [TikTok Shop](https://shop.tiktok.com/business/en), and [TikTok Coin](https://www.tiktok.com/coin) website, it can be seen that they make money in 3 main venues: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. [In-app Advertising](https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/solutions/ads): TikTok provides a platform for brands to advertise their products and services to its large user base. The platform has various ad formats such as in-feed ads, brand takeovers, branded lenses (AR filter), and more. TikTok's powerful recommendation engine and advanced targeting capabilities make it an attractive platform for advertisers.\r\n2. [E-commerce](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/17/more-brands-are-now-testing-tiktoks-shop-feature-in-the-u-s/): TikTok is also exploring e-commerce opportunities through its new feature, TikTok Shop. This feature allows users to buy products directly within the app from select merchants, and they take a cut from each product sold. TikTok also has partnerships with e-commerce platforms such as Shopify ([Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/sell-on-tiktok)), making it easier for brands to sell their products directly to TikTok users.\r\n3. [In-App Purchases](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2023/03/01/tiktok-earned-205-million-more-than-facebook-twitter-snap-and-instagram-combined-on-in-app-purchases-in-2023/?sh=36c003ac42d4) (IAP): TikTok IAP consists of “coins” that users may purchase to tip creators while they stream on TikTok Live. The smallest offering is 70 coins with the price of $0.74. These coins are used by viewers to purchase gifts, which go to the streamer and are rendered as quick animations that play during a stream.\r\n\r\n**Business Fundamentals: **\r\n\r\nIt is hard to find the exact revenue number for TikTok since the company does not release public materials. However, according to [the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/14/technology/tiktok-ads-social-media.html), the platform is “on track to make nearly $10 billion in ad revenue, more than double what it generated last year, according to estimates from the research company Insider Intelligence.” To put this in perspective, TikTok now makes double the money Snapchat makes, with half the time since existence, and on Ads revenue alone.\r\n\r\nFurther, according to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2023/03/01/tiktok-earned-205-million-more-than-facebook-twitter-snap-and-instagram-combined-on-in-app-purchases-in-2023/?sh=36c003ac42d4), for the In-App Purchase segment, TikTok generated “over $350 million in in-app revenue. In 2020, the same quarter hit just $150 million. Both numbers pale before its full-year revenue from last year.” They further wrote: “TikTok has had IAPs [in-app purchases] since its very beginning and its app revenue last year was a whopping $1.5 billion,” What this means for the industry is that more platforms need to recognize the significance of IAPs, as it is simply a piece of revenue too big to be ignored.\r\n\r\nFor TikTok Shop, according to [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/17/more-brands-are-now-testing-tiktoks-shop-feature-in-the-u-s/), its features are still being tested in the U.S.. However, they also reported that Shop might not be viable after all in the American and European market following the disappointing launch in the UK.\r\n\r\nIn regards to demographic data, [eMarketer and Insider Intelligence reported](https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/tiktok-surpasses-snapchat-favorite-app-of-teens) that it has surpassed Snapchat as the favorite platform for teens from 12 to 17. In 2023, there are 17.3 million people in the U.S. in this age group using TikTok at least once a month. Further, according to [Datareportal’s report](https://datareportal.com/?utm_source=Statista&utm_medium=Data_Citation_Hyperlink&utm_campaign=Data_Partners&utm_content=Statista_Data_Citation), 38.9% of TikTok users are adults from 18-24, while 32.4% are from 25-34. From these data, it is apparent that TikTok is an app dominated by teens and young adults.\r\n\r\n\r\n    **Recent and Current Initiatives:**\r\n\r\nTikTok has recently undertaken a number of initiatives aimed at improving user experience as well as supporting creators and businesses. Some of these initiatives include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. [Creator Fund](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/tiktok-creator-fund-your-questions-answered): In July 2020, TikTok launched a $200 million Creator Fund, which provides financial support to eligible creators on the platform. The creators are the heart of TikTok’s user-generated content focused business, thus supporting them is crucial to its success.\r\n2. [AR Filters and Effects](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-use-create-ar-filters-tiktok-effect-house/): TikTok regularly updates its AR filters and effects to keep the platform engaging and entertaining for users, similar to Snapchat who’s aiming at young adults. These features let creators “create,” hence align with their values on promoting creativity. \r\n3. [Social-commerce](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/17/more-brands-are-now-testing-tiktoks-shop-feature-in-the-u-s/): As discussed above, the TikTok shop is a new initiative by TikTok as an effort to replicate its [tremendous success](https://restofworld.org/2022/tiktok-won-e-commerce-livestreaming-china/) in the Chinese market, though it is not proven to work in Western ones. \r\n4. [New social media platform Lemon8](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/25/bytedance-pushes-lemon8-app-in-the-us-as-tiktok-faces-a-ban.html):  According to [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/23/tiktok-gears-up-for-its-big-day-in-congress/), TikTok is under heavy scrutiny from the governments outside of China due to its link with the Chinese Communist Party. The concern stems from the fact that they are collecting user data from all over the world, and this poses risks to national defense, as well as the integrity of the user’s privacy. Amidst the struggle, TikTok seeks to push users towards its other platform - Lemon8. This initiative can be seen as a potential alternative to TikTok should a ban happen. The platform had previously successfully launched in the Chinese and Japanese markets, where it positioned itself as a “lifestyle app focused on health, wellness, and beauty.” Recently, it was reported by [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/28/tiktok-ban-backup-plan-bytedance-owned-instagram-rival-lemon8-hits-the-u-s-app-stores-top-10/) that the app just hit Top 10 in the US Top App Charts, showing its potential for incredible growth in the North American Market. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Conclusion: \r\n\r\n**\t**Social media plays an integral part in our lives, and it is constantly evolving each and every day. These evolutions stem majorly from our advancements in technology, as well as concerns in both the economic and international-political landscape. While some are making wild success like the TikTok short content, some prove to be missteps like the Metaverse. Despite the various directions the industry is taking, it still is making an impact in the way we interact and communicate with each other, and it’s definitely fascinating to see where the industry is heading in the future. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Current Trends & Future Developments\r\n\r\n**\t**Word Count: 2074 words\r\n\r\n\r\n## Introduction:\r\n\r\n\tSocial media companies operate on the foundation that is the development of society, technology, and innovations. They always seek to enhance their platform in order to grow, to stay competitive and relevant in the ever changing industry. Nowadays, what this translates to is the integration of the latest technology, as well as the pursuit of emerging models and strategies that are both profitable and fitting to the socio-political compass. This section aims to explore the latest social media trends, and analyze their impact on various aspects of both business and society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Core Business Summary:\r\n1. **Revenue:**\r\n\r\nSocial media companies generate the majority of their revenue by selling ad space on their platforms, leveraging their massive user base to collect data on user behaviors and interests. By doing so, they ensure that advertisements are delivered efficiently to the appropriate target audience, thereby satisfying their clients. \r\n\r\nOther revenue sources, despite not taking as much percentage, include subscriptions, where users pay monthly for extra features like a verification tick, early access to features, and the ability to use NFTs. Platforms targeting a specific audience like LinkedIn also generate revenue from solving or advising on companies’ human resources and marketing problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. **Cost:**\r\n\r\n\tThe costs to operate a social media platform includes Cost of Revenue (or infrastructure and maintenance), Research and Development, Sales and Marketing, and General Administration. Cost of Revenue takes up on average a third of total cost, and generally directly proportional to the platform’s growth/ expansions. The same can be said for sales and marketing. Research and development takes up a major portion of cost, typically the biggest portion, while general administrative costs are usually the lowest and the most stable. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. **Recent Changes / Disruptions:**\r\n\r\nFor the past two years, Social ad revenue shows signs of slow growth ([eMarketer](https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/social-media-trends-watch-2023#page-report)). TikTok’s ad revenue is expected to “grow much more slowly (43%) in 2023 than in 2022 (115%). Meta’s advertising revenue will be expected to increase just 8.2% in 2023. This pushes companies to seek other revenue streams, most notably a subscription model, which was pioneered by Twitter and LinkedIn. The subscription comes with offerings of the blue verification checkmark, and the ability to exclusively use new features like AI and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens).\r\n\r\nFurther, we see the cracking down on data privacy in the industry by the government. Madi Richardson touched on this in [her blog](https://mtr370.tumblr.com/post/711156639112298496/us-legislation-might-eventually-ban-tiktok), where she mentioned Congress' negative view on the act of data collection, especially by ByteDance’s TikTok. They see it as a tool to surveil and exploit the personal information of Americans, thus posing a national security threat. She also mentioned how the ban will affect other issues like music discoverability in the US, and the overall economic impact a ban will cause. This also prompts TikTok’s other social media app, Lemon8, to climb the top app ladder. [Ziyu Deng](https://zdeng777.tumblr.com/post/713520697820004352/new-app-alert-lemon8) covered this in detail, reasoning that it can be viewed as a backup plan should TikTok be banned in the States. \r\n\r\nThis crackdown also leads to data licensing, which was partially a revenue source for Twitter, becoming questionable moving forward. The already-in-place restrictions, not just from the government but also private companies as well, forced social media companies to seek other unique selling propositions like AI (artificial intelligence), AR (augmented reality), and more. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the vision for a potential virtual reality proved to be a costly gamble, as according to [a report by CBS](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/meta-stock-down-earnings-700-billion-in-lost-value/), Meta so far has lost $9.4 billion on the Metaverse. The loss influenced many rounds of layoffs at several media and tech companies, impacting the lives of tens of thousands of people. Following these reports, Lancer Zhang also wrote in [his blogs](https://lancerzhang.tumblr.com/post/710472585637445633/is-metaverse-bubble-bursting-tencent-tempering) about how Tencent is also lowering their VR ambitions, yet the topic is still in discussion. Companies are focusing more on the offering of their platforms and the different strategies to gain the next generation of audience, through enhancing their existing experience rather than creating something completely new.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Current Trends:\r\n1. **AI (Artificial Intelligence integration):**\r\n\r\nWith the “slowing down” of The Metaverse/ Digital Reality (Meta is still pouring billions into developing this vision, according to [Social Media Today](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/meta-shows-increases-in-usage-and-revenue-in-q1-though-vr-costs-continue-t/648755/)), companies are looking to invest in the next big thing to make sure they capture the user’s attention. And this next big thing seems to be AI. \r\n\r\nIt was recently reported that Facebook is finding success in its new [AI-powered Advantage+ offerings](https://duyonmedia.blogspot.com/2023/03/meta-introduces-its-own-subscription.html), where AI makes the process of targeting and running ads automated for businesses. Further, they are also integrating AI to make [personalized stories](https://duyonmedia.blogspot.com/2023/04/facebooks-uses-ai-to-create.html), where stories are made automatically by combining different memories or images. These AI offerings mostly target businesses, and keep them coming back to advertise on the platform as access to personal data is increasingly restricted.\r\n\r\nOn the everyday user’s side, AI is integrated directly to enhance the user experience. TikTok recently revealed their [Generative AI profile images](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/TikTok-Tests-Generative-AI-Profile-Images/648619/) to make personalized profile pictures based on images the user uploads. For Snapchat, their most recent initiative is the My AI chatbot assistant, powered by the famous ChatGPT. The chatbot helps answer any questions one might have, right in their inbox. However, the execution and placement of these bots has recently received negative feedback from the users. According to [this article by TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/24/snapchat-sees-spike-in-1-star-reviews-as-users-pan-the-my-ai-feature-calling-for-its-removal/), where it was revealed that there was a huge surge of 1-star reviews since the bot’s launch, hindering the true value of an AI Chatbot on their platform. \r\n\r\nWe also see the launch of new players that base their unique selling proposition on the integration of AI like Artifact. The emerging platform recommends articles that they think the user will like to read, through AI. Krystal Wan covered this in [her article](https://krystalwww.blogspot.com/2023/02/instagram-co-founders-created-artifact.html), where she noted that “the publication of Artifact again proves the growing popularity of AI in social media.” However, she also raises issues regarding how AI decides which content should appear, and that could be seen as a form of censorship, which increases political biases and polarization. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. **Short-form Content:**\r\n\r\nThe second trend appears to be short-form content. Following TikTok’s explosive growth, social media companies are realizing that short 30-second videos keep the users hooked constantly, and therefore keep them on the platform for longer. According to [reports by eMarketer](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/content/enforced/253155-SP23_MCC-UE_1020_1_001/Time_Spent_on_TikTok_eMarketer.pdf), “adult TikTok users will spend nearly 56 minutes on the app per day in 2023.” This means a 103% increase in time spent per day for TikTok in a 4 year period. To put this in perspective, time spent on Youtube is only 15% over the same period. Taking advantage of the user’s short attention span, the addictive nature of the short-form content is the driving force behind TikTok’s recent growth and domination.\r\n\r\nOver the past two years, Meta and Youtube have all integrated short-form content into their platforms. They are Facebook and Instagram Reels, and Youtube Shorts. In the same report, eMarketer acknowledged that this content is both “helping and hurting Meta,” as the view time increases, but the time spent on their feed and stories features is “cannibalized,” thus leading to fewer ads being presented to their audience. It will be interesting to see how these companies can further monetize this form of content, and how they can improve it to stay competitive. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. **Social Commerce and Live Streaming/ Live Shopping: **\r\n\r\n\tSocial commerce, as defined by [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/software-platforms/why-shopping-set-social-revolution), is the “integration of social experiences and ecommerce transactions in a single path to purchase, enabled by a platform,” and it has already established a major market in Asian countries, especially China. According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1251145/social-commerce-sales-worldwide/)’s 2023 report, worldwide social commerce sales is valued at $992 billion USD in 2022, and is expected to reach up to $1.7 trillion USD in 2024. These experiences are not only related to advertising, but also includes innovative product showcases, better brand representations, and most importantly, platforms for direct-to-consumer (D2C) sales.\r\n\r\n\tAccording to [Accenture’s report](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/software-platforms/why-shopping-set-social-revolution), social commerce works because of 3 principal engagement factors: content-driven, experience-driven, and network-driven. Through social media platforms, unique contents are created by the brand, and it allows constant, authentic discovery and actions. The content brings higher results when being endorsed by influencers or individuals. This can be seen as word-of-mouth marketing, but on steroids. They put a face to the product, they bring authenticity, and most importantly, a wider reach towards specific customer segments. \r\n\r\nExperience driven is enabled through different types of engagements like AR/ VR. There are also “game experiences” that businesses can take advantage of to drive engagement to their products. Once they’ve tried the product and decided to proceed to the next funneling step, the platform makes it easier to make direct purchases right after. For example, Instagram businesses can set up their own store in the app; the ads or stories come with a ‘shop now’ button to take them directly to the product’s page; TikTok began a [partnership](https://news.shopify.com/scaling-social-commerce-shopify-introduces-new-in-app-shopping-experiences-on-tiktok) with Shopify to directly push dropshipping products directly on their store; etc,... The emphasis is on the direct-ness of these features, and how they’ve enabled millions of purchases with ease.\r\n\r\nLastly, it is network-driven. Brands connect, chat, and help their customers on these platforms with ease. But this not only restricts to customer service, the platform also facilitates networking capabilities between businesses, thus driving trends like bulk discount procurements. This promotes good will in between vendors, and also supports ‘live streaming commerce,’ where live streamers earn commission for each product sale they make.\r\n\r\nIn China, [eMarketer](https://www.insiderintelligence.com/router/?logout=1&returnurl=https%3A%2F%2Fsubscriptions-na1.emarketer.com%2FAccount%2FLogin%3FreturnUrl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcontent-na1.emarketer.com%252Fasia-pacific-trends-watch-2023%26pr%3Dtrue) reported that live streaming commerce (or live shopping) sold over $514 billion USD in 2022, and it is growing at 19%. This is more than 17% of all e-commerce sales in China. By establishing networks among influencers and creators, brands achieve better product sales, and not only that, the platforms themselves gain more revenue from potential ad spend. However, despite achieving major success in Asian markets, recent initiatives by social media platforms in the US hinders the true growth of such a proposition. In early 2023, [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/14/23599924/instagram-live-shopping-removal) reported that Instagram will no longer let creators tag products in livestreams starting in March. While Meta conserves itself, other platforms like TikTok and Youtube hope to work on their live-shopping features. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. **Focus on Creators:**\r\n\r\n\tRita Vinnik, TikTok’s Director of Creator Initiatives, said in her presentation that “Creators are the heart and soul of TikTok.” The creators are those who both attract and retain new as well as existing users. The traditional social media platform model thrives on interactions between users, but now, they thrive on content and keeping a constant supply of entertainment. The longer the users stay on the platform, the better, and the way to keep them using it is by constantly feeding them content. To ensure their growth, social media companies, not only TikTok but also Meta and Youtube, provide their own initiatives to keep creators creating.\r\n\r\n\tThese initiatives, for TikTok, come in the form of educating businesses on the power of influencer marketing and helping facilitate connections between the two. They also have [funds](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/tiktok-creator-fund-your-questions-answered) that reward creators for their contents. Meta introduces the “[Creators of Tomorrow](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/meta-launches-creators-of-tomorrow-initiative-to-highlight-emerging-digit/631266/#:~:text=Meta%20Launches%20'Creators%20of%20Tomorrow'%20Initiative%20to%20Highlight%20Emerging%20Digital%20Artists,-Published%20Sept.&text=Meta%20is%20on%20a%20mission,keep%20them%20posting%20more%20often.)” Initiative in September 2022, helping creators “build an audience, and monetize that attention, in the hopes that this will see them increase their reliance on its apps and tools, and keep them posting more often.” Youtube provides training and grants through their [Youtube Creator Academy](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/resources/lessons/youtube-creator-academy-improve-your-youtube-skills/), where they help creators perfect their video production and marketing skills. In today’s social media industry, content is king, and everyone is making their best effort to gain the most viewing time from their audience. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Conclusion:\r\n\r\nIn recent years, companies have constantly been trying to reinvent themselves with new unique propositions. For Facebook it’s the Metaverse, for Snap it’s Virtual Reality, for Twitter it’s subscription models, and more. However, with the information gathered from recent developments, it’s quite clear that the next major trend that’s coming to the industry is artificial intelligence, and also the increased refocus on improving existing platforms rather than branching out to radical ventures.\r\n\r\nGoing further, the rise of social commerce has opened up new opportunities for businesses to connect with consumers and drive sales directly through social media platforms. Debates arise around the impact of social media on data privacy, the spread of misinformation, and the role of tech companies in regulating content. As we move forward, the social media industry will continue to shape and influence our personal and professional lives, but it is still crucial for individuals, businesses, and policymakers to navigate this landscape with a critical eye and a commitment to responsible usage.\r\n",
